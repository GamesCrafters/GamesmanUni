However, we are playing the misére variant, so you LOSE if you create a 3-in-a-row.",

Once a player has moved to an open spot, the departure square becomes occupied and neither player is allowed to move into that space. The game ends when there is no more room for a player to move. The last person to make a legal move wins.",

A dragon can also eat a swan by jumping over it to an empty space. The dragons' goal is to eat all of the swans. The swans player starts by placing one swan per turn. After all 12 swans have been placed, the swans player during each turn moves one swan to an orthogonally adjacent empty space. The swans' goal is to trap the drgaons.",

The players, blue and red, alternate picking and coloring an uncolored edge. You lose if you make a triangle of only your color. This triangle must have vertices as endpoints -- intersecting lines do not make a new vertex. You win if you force your opponent to make a closed triangle of their color."

                    <p><strong>Remoteness:</strong> The "Remoteness" value of a game's position indicates, assuming perfect play, how many moves remain until the end of the game (i.e., a leaf node in the game tree).</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>The "Remoteness View" tracks the remoteness value throughout the game and can be metaphorically thought of as a tug-of-war, representing the shifting balance of the game between the two players. In the image below, the red node in the first row indicates that, assuming perfect play, player two will win in 11 turns. Any drawing positions will be placed below the <strong>'D'</strong> label.</p>

                    <p><strong>Win By:</strong> The "Win By" value shows, assuming perfect play, the number of points or pieces by which the current player is expected to win over the opponent by the end of the game. Perfect play when prioritizing Win By is when both players are trying to maximize their final score; regardless of how long the game takes (remoteness does not matter).</p>
                    <p>The "Win By View" tracks the Win By value throughout the game. A vertical line of nodes in the Win By View indicates perfect play from both players prioritizing by win by.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pure Draw:</strong> A subset of draw positions are considered to be "Pure Draw" when a player can force the other player to a draw position that has losing moves or draw-losing moves.</p>

                    <p><strong>Draw Level Fringe:</strong> The subset of draw positions in the pure draw subset which have losing moves (if draw level = 0) or draw-losing moves (if draw level > 0).</p>

                    <p><strong>Draw Remoteness:</strong> The "Draw Remoteness" value of a game's pure draw position indicates, assuming perfect play, how many moves until the draw fringe.</p>
                    <p>The "Draw Level View" keeps track of the "Draw Level" and the "Draw Remoteness" of Pure Draw Positions. Any Non-Draw (ND) positions or Non-Pure Draw (NPD) positions will be placed below the <strong>'ND/NPD*'</strong> label.</p>
